        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Brown Chuck Roast Steak:</b> Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More function. Wait until it says HOT
                (~8 mins). Pat dry the chuck roast steak and lightly season one side with salt + black pepper. Drizzle
                the inner pot with 1 tbsp olive oil. Then, place the seasoned side of chuck roast in Instant Pot.
                Lightly season the other side with more salt + black pepper. <br>
                <u>*Pro Tip:</u> Brown each side for 10 minutes to develop some awesome deep flavors.<br>
                <u>*Note:</u> If you prefer a "Dump-it-all-in" Recipe, you can skip the browning and saute steps.
            </li>
            <li><b>Saute Onion and Garlic</b> Set browned chuck roast aside. Add in sliced onions, then saute until
                softened (~3 - 4 mins). Set aside roughly ⅓ of the softened onions for later. Add in minced garlic, a
                pinch of dried rosemary, a pinch of thyme, and 2 bay leaves. Saute for another minute.<br>
                <u>*Pro Tip:</u> Your Instant Pot will stop sauteeing after 30 minutes, turn it back on by pressing
                "Saute" button.
            </li>
            <li><b>Deglaze Instant Pot:</b> Pour 1 cup unsalted stock in Instant Pot, then deglaze by scrubbing all the
                flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. </li>
            <li><b>Pressure Cook Chuck Roast: </b> Add in 1 tbsp (15ml) soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15ml) fish sauce, and 1 tbsp
                (15ml) Worcestershire sauce. Give it a quick mix. Place browned chuck roast back in Instant Pot and
                partially submerge it into the liquid as best as you can. Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 45 minutes
                + 25 minutes Natural Release.</li>
            <li><b>Simmer Au Jus Sauce and Shred beef: </b> Set aside chuck roast in a mixing bowl, and shred the beef
                with 2 forks. While you are shredding the beef, bring Au Jus sauce back to a boil with the "Saute"
                function. Add in reserved onions, then let the Au Jus sauce reduce for 5 - 10 minutes. Taste & adjust
                seasoning accordingly. <br>
                <u>*Pro Tip:</u> Reducing the Au Jus sauce will naturally thicken it. If you find the Au Jus sauce to be
                too oily, you can use a Fat Separator to filter out the fat.
            </li>
            <li><b>Assemble and Serve: </b> Optional Step - While the Au Jus sauce is reducing, preheat oven to 350°F.
                Layer 1 loaf of french bread with slices of Swiss cheese on top. Place it in the oven until the cheese
                begins to melt.
                Layer shredded beef and onions on top of the sandwich. Serve Instant Pot French Dip with savory umami Au
                Jus sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
